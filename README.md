# Note Taker

## Description

This note taker generates and stores notes for later use. These notes are stored via JSON.

The app includes APIs, Express.js, and GET & POST requests to change webpages and modify stored data.

## Installation

If Node.js is not already installed in your system, you can get it at <https://nodejs.org>. Once installed, download the files in the repository. The files can then be accessed/opened in a command line window (either Command Prompt, Terminal, or Git Bash depending on what your system & what you have installed).

Within the command line, type "npm i" to install the app's dependencies (Express.js and UUID).

## Usage

Open the website (<>) and press the "Get Started" button. Enter a title and description for a new note, then press the "Save" icon in the top-right corner to save the note.

Past notes can be accessed by clicking on them in the left column, and they can be deleted by clicking on the red "trash" icon next to them. Existing text is cleared when the top-right "plus" icon is pressed - allowing the user to create a new note.
